## How to upload your data?

The Quartet Multi-omics reference materials and raw datasets are publicly available and accessible. Researchers are encouraged to access and analyze the datasets. The recipients of the Reference Materials are highly encouraged to share their data with Fudan University through the Quartet Data Portal in order for us to improve the reference datasets and to better serve the community.

Users can upload their in-house omics data generated with the Quartet reference sample, select the specific pipeline and parameters, and obtain the analysis results and QC results, which can be managed by the Quartet Data Portal.

Users should follow the steps:
1) Create a dataset by clicking the 'Register & Upload Your Data'
2) Get your access key and secret by clicking 'New Token' button
3) Review the data specification before uploading files
4) Upload your omics data files and metadata files
5) Verify and confirm Uploaded files by clicking 'Check' button

After you checking your data, the Quartet team will receive an email notification. And then, we will review your uploaded files and publish these data into Quartet Data Portal.
