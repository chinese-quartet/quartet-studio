### DNA-Seq
For whole-genome sequencing, the quality assessment is started from FASTQ files and can be divided into three parts: pre-alignment quality assessment, post-alignment assessment, and small variants calling results assessment. The quality of pre-alignment is assessed by FastQC and FastQ Screen, while post-alignment is assessed by Qualimap. The performance of variants calling results are evaluated by reference datasets and Quartet family-dependent built-in genetic truth. MultiQC was used for compiling QC results together. Pre-alignment and Post-alignment quality assessment are not available if user start from VCF files.
