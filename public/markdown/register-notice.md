### How to register an account?
<p style="text-align: justify;">
You can access the <a href="http://chinese-quartet.org" target="_blank">Quartet Data Portal</a> and request reference materials as a guest. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We will receive the notification email after you submit a request for the reference materials. Our staff will contact you for further confirming your information and request (such as your organization, delivery address, required reference materials and quantity, purpose etc.). If we agree to the application, we will sent you a registration email and delivery the reference materials to you. Once you have registered, please go back to the home page (http://chinese-quartet.org) to log in. 
</p>

### Why can't you register a Quartet Data Portal account by yourself?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The reason there is no "Register" button is that the general process is for users to apply for reference materials as a guest first. This is to facilitate the confirmation of the applicant's information as well as to build a trust and consensus between the two parties, and at all times applicants should avoid uploading and analyzing non-Quartet data on our platform.
